#GoT Map

GoT Map is a simple map project that shows Houses from Game of Thrones as if they were located in real countries! To open, clone/download the repo and open 'index.html'.

The page shows all the GoT Houses the app has currently in a list, and a map pinpoints these locations with a marker. Click on a list item or a marker to show more information about the House (retrieved from the 'API of Ice and Fire' GoT Rest API. You can also filter the list and markers by typing into the search bar.
